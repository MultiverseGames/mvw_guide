<p>Here will be displayed to you the summary of attacks on you and what you did on
others. First will be the summary of attacks on you by other players. They will
be in order of when they occurred, the person who performed the attack, if
currency was stolen and how much, damage you dealt, damage taken by enemy, and
then a link for the actual battle report with full details can also be found in
each row for that single attack. Each attack has a detailed Battle Report which
you can review</p>

on others.</p>

<ul class="lists-caret">
<li>
<strong>Offensive Power</strong>
- The opponent's Offensive Power, which can be compared with your own. E.G.
if your Opponent has a power of 100 and you have a power of 50 there is a
pretty good chance that you will have no chance of defeating them. This of
course depends on what type of ships you have compared to them.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Hull Power</strong>
- Your Opponent's Hull Power determines if their ship/s will be destroyed in
an attack run. E.G. if the hull power is 20, and the attack power is 2, for
that class of ship, you will require 10 ships to destroy this ship.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Covert Power</strong>
- This is the complete total of your opponent's Covert Power. This will
determine if your account can spy on this user or not. Be careful however,
as if your spies are caught, they may not return, and will be interrogated
to determine where they have come from. In this instance, the person you spy
on will know who spied on them and may attack you.
