<p>
Population growth is important, but it isn't nearly as important as it had been
prior because of the new system that was implemented. One tip would be to put
only a hundred or so units into mining, and then use the rest for covert and
farming. </p>

<p>If players want, they can also hire some units as farmers, but I'd advise for
low-ranking players not to do this, as it will just open them up to being farmed
more often. </p>
If they want somewhere to store their credits, they can instead put down all their
units as farmers and then keep building up their fleet -- use the ships as a bank
account. Once you have enough, un-train the ships and get "X" amount of money back,
which can be put towards an upgrade. </p>

<p>As for those who are severely over-powered by their fellow players; they need to
remember the exploration option that has been made available recently. If they
are going to be going without attacking for a prolonged time, send the ships out
on an exploration mission and just return in 7.5 hours to collect your
resources. </p>
