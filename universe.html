<h3 class="block-title">Universe - Interacting with other players</h3>

<p>Every single account that is currently active can be found on these pages in
    order of their overall rank. Their army size and resources on hand will be
    displayed to you depending on your covert power compared to theirs. You can
    then
    click on the persons name to see their profile page and take actions like
    sending
    them a message or attacking them. Every 30 minutes your account will
    automatically generate <?php $conf["attackTurns_per_turn"] ;?> new Attack
    Turns (AT), which you can use for one of the attack
    types.</p>

<p>Players not on protection will see two buttons. The Attack Button:
    <button class="btn btn-xs" name="attack">
        <i class="fa fa-crosshairs"></i>
    </button>
    and the Spy Button:
    <button class="btn btn-xs" name="spy">
        <i class="fa fa-eye"></i>
    </button>
    . Clicking on either of these buttons in the Universe Page will allow the
    player
    to instantly attack their target. A word of caution, as if your target is
    stronger than you are, there is no backing out.

<!--<p> Commander Power/Ranks - Power is based on the officers total attack power and
covert power weighted at 99% and 1% respectively. The weighting helps hide the
actual powers a little and is subject to adjustments in the future as covert
levels go up higher.</p> -->

<p>Clicking on a player account allows you to see their profile page. From here
    you
    have the following options
<dl>
    <dt>
        <b>Attack</b>
    </dt>
    <dd>Attacking another player allows you to destroy their Ships, if your
        fleet
        are larger in size or power than theirs, you will be be able to obtain a
        specified amount of their Credits, Food and Metals. This retrieved
        income is
        added to your own to use with as you wish. However if it is not used
        quickly
        another player can steal them away from you.

        <b>Spy</b>
    </dt>
    <dd>Spying on another player allows you to see certain account details in
        their
        account, particularly their army size, and allocation of resources.
        Their
        covert, defensive and attack capabilities. Their population growth, and
        attack turns and their current alert level.

    <dt>
        <b>Send Message</b>
    </dt>
    <dd>You may want to communicate with another player, in order to do this, we
        have provided players with their own "in-game email". This will send a
        communication to another player.
    </dd>

    <dt>
        <b>Give MV Points</b>
    </dt>
    <dd>Players who have purchased MV Points can send them to other players from
        this page.
    </dd>
    <br>
    <dt>
        <b>Make this user my commander</b>
    </dt>
    <dd>Setting a user as a commander is beneficial for both parties. Officers
        gain
        a percentage of the Commanders income (10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%). In
        return
        the commanders get a population bonus of the officers total unit
        production.

        (25/{# of officers} +20)*({officer rate}/30). This means with a single
        officer you get a bonus equal to 30% of their population growth. With 2
        officers you get 17.5% of each and so on. Overall your bonus still goes
        up
        with the more officers you have but not quite as high as it used to be
        for
        those with higher number of officers.
