<h3 class="block-title">Turn Based Text Games</h3>

<p>Multiverse Warriors is a Text Based Browser Game. This style of game was popular
in the 1980's. We feel that modern games are too much about graphics and less
about substance, and communities, in other words a quick buck. Think about how
many games you have seen that in a year, you might play it. We have created a
game that will allow players to shape their story, shape the story of the game,
and visualize their ships, populations, and battles in whatever way they see
fit.</p>

<p>Our game is all about the story, a story that is created by the community of
players, and enhanced by our staff. We hope you enjoy our game, and get involved
in the community on our Forums, in our Chat Rooms, and within the game
itself. </p>

<h3 class="block-title">The Story of Multiverse Warriors</h3>

<p>Hello... Try not to speak, as you need to conserve your strength. We didn't think
you would have survived the revival process, the miners found your life pod
buried deep in the planet, and from the few records before the great war, we know
you are exactly what we need to survive! We are humbled by your presence. We know
much about you, and when you've recovered, we would like you to lead our people.
From the moment we found you, you were destined to lead, but we never imagined
that we would require your leadership so soon.
<br/>
<br/>

Much has happened, during your slumber, and I suppose you wish to hear all about
<strong>The Multiverse....</strong>
and the Multiverse Warriors!
<br/>
<br/>

The Multiverse was discovered by accident many years ago, by one of the more advanced races,
their hubris caused the destruction of their universe.... Our uni... No all universes, and
the peoples left are all that remain. In your method of time, several hundred years have
passed. I know that you were a great explorer of your people, but I am afraid to tell you 
that your peoples goals have changed since they sent you into the Multiverse Breach 
We know your values and methods and we need you to join the Multiverse Universe as the new leader of our people. We have
established a colony, away from the politics, the wars, the battles, and the plights that
have led us here, and during that time led a peaceful life.

<br/>
<br/>

Unfortunately, we have grown to such a number that we have now been discovered by
the others! They know we are here! And they could attack at any moment, and
believe me, whether we fight or do nothing they will come and plunder our lands.
The universe as you know it has fallen, as new races and species with powers and
technology you can not imagine exist out there. Some are peaceful, others.....
not so much. There are great wars involving thousands of ships, some as large as
the moons themselves! We have lived in peace for so long that our people can not
think like a military leader which is what we need for the Warriors to respect us
enough to fight for us.
<br/>
<br/>

The Multiverse Warriors are the armies of the Universe, they are the peoples cast
out of society for their violent ways, and if you can believe it actually enjoy
fighting! After the last great war, our respective governments decided that all
weapons will be outlawed. The Warriors left known space, and for a time, our
universe was safe, secure, and most important prospered. Then without provocation
a world consumed by greed sought out the Multiverse Warriors, and offered them
resources for the use of their ships. The Warriors agreed, and offered to remain
loyal in excahnged for the continual supply of food to feed their crews.
<br/>
<br/>

You will start out with an undeveloped world, our world! From there you will
attempt to turn that into a mighty empire capable of defending itself, or at best
scaring our potential enemies into thinking attacking us would be a very bad
idea.
<br/>
<br/>

We need you to create an economic and military infrastructure to support your
quest for growth and the next greatest technological achievements. Our peoples
will support you in whatever decision you make!
<br/>
<br/>

If you wish to wage war against other empires as you struggle with other factions
to gain the materials we required to grow as a society, the Warriors will support
you.
<br/>
<br/>

If you can, negotiate with other leaders and create an alliance or trade for much
needed resources to continue to grow.
<br/>
<br/>

As I'm sure you already know, as with times gone past, you must build an armada
to enforce your will throughout the universe.
<br/>
<br/>

And you must hoard your resources behind an impregnable wall of ships with
powerful shields. Or store them in hidden banks on our planet!
<br/>

Whatever you wish to do, The Multiverse Warriors can let you do it.
<br/>
<br/>

Will you terrorize all around you? Or will you strike fear into the hearts of
those who attack the helpless?
