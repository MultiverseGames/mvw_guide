<p>Here you can link your Facebook Account, change your email account, change
password, change game name (to get more name changes purchase them on 'MV Points'
page), change race (you do not lose any stats, plus you get to reassign your base
points to a different configuration), go on vacation.</p>

<h3 class="block-title">Preferences - Recruitment</h3>

<p>This page describes how the recruitment system works along with including the
links needed. When someone joins the game via your link and then if they donate
to the game you also get a bonus of MV points each time they donate. For more
details check out the page.</p>

<h3 class="block-title">Preferences - Vacation</h3>

<p>In order to go on Vacation, you must not have attacked / spied on anyone in the
previous 24 hours. Vacation lasts a minimum of 48 hours. During this time your
account is removed from the attacking realm and no action takes place on your
account (income, population growth do not occur). You are essentially non
existent in the game! You will not be able to login during this time, and you
will not be able to go back on Vacation for another 24 hours (+24 hours if you
attack / spy on another player).
<strong>Players who on Vacation for 180 days or more may have their account
automatically deleted.
</strong>
We recommend logging in once during these periods. In certain circumstances an
email may be sent to the registered email address 1 week prior to deletion.
