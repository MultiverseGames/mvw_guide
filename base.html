<p>This page is a general information page for your account - the hub of all
information. From here, you can see all of your account details and your ranking
in each area compared to other players. Your general income and the upkeep and
current status of your ships.</p>

<p>You can also change your
<strong>Alert Level</strong>
which is responsible for controlling output produced by your units. Increasing
your Alert Level will reduce (but not prevent) the chances of you getting
attacked after turns. This is split into 5 different settings:

<ul class="lists-caret">
<li>
<strong>None</strong>
- This is your production running at 100% / Normal Working Conditions
</li>
<li>
<strong>Low</strong>
- Production is reduced by 10%
</li>
<li>
<strong>Medium</strong>
- Production is reduced by 20%
</li>
<li>
<strong>High</strong>
- Production is reduced by 40%
</li>
<li>
<strong>Critical</strong>
- Production is reduced by 70%
</li>
</ul>

Players should try and modify their Alert Levels when offline / online for good
strategy. Note - Reducing your alert level also decreases the bonuses provided to
officers.
