<h3 class="block-title">Officers</h3>

<p>By default, officer's are turned on, meaning that you can make any player your
	commander. Here you can disable additional people from making you their
	commander. As a commander you provide a percentage of your income to each officer
	in return for a percentage of their population growth. This can be set between
	10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% of your income which is then added to your officers total
income. The formula for this is: (10/{# of officers} +5)*({officer rate}/30)</p>

<p>Commanders get a bonus from having officers. The formula is: (25/{# of officers}
	+5)*({officer rate}/30). This means with a single officer you get a bonus equal
	to 30% of their population growth. With 2 officers you get 17.5% of each and so
on. Overall your bonus still goes up with the more officers you have. </p>
