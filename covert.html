<h3 class="block-title">Operations</h3>

<p>The universe is a place full of unknowns. There are many dangers and enemies
    out there. In order to gain knowledge of your foe, you need to perform
    Covert Operations on them.</p>

<p>Covert Operations can be small or large. Sending a smaller team will make it
    harder to detect, but a larger team will yield faster results.</p>

<p>In order to deploy a Covert Operation, you must first have some spies
    available. You can deploy them to another player's realm by visiting their
    player
    page. Your will see panel allowing you to
    <strong>deploy</strong>
    or
    <strong>recall</strong>
    your spies from their realm.
</p>

<p>Each spy will cost you
    <strong>10</strong>
    food to deploy. Spies may be recalled instantly at any time for no
    additional cost.
</p>

<p> While deployed, your spies will accumulate
    <strong>intel points</strong>
    against the target player. As you gain intel points, more sections of your
    intel report on that player will become unlocked.
</p>

<p>The quantity of intel points required to unlock information varies from
    player to
    player. Players with
    larger empires and more spies will require more points.</p>

<p>
    You can deploy a limited number of operations at any given time. This number
    can be increased by upgrading your
    <strong>Covert Level</strong>
    . Operations with no units deployed do not count towards your limit, but
    will rapidly lose intel points.
</p>

<h3 class="block-title">Reports</h3>

<p>To access a report containing your intel on a player, click the
    <strong>View Intel</strong>
    button found at the bottom of each operation panel, located on each player's
    page or the
    <strong>Covert Operations</strong>
    page, accessed from the main menu.
</p>

<p>
    Depending on the progress percentage of your operation against the player,
    this report will display information on their current resources, powers,
    research, population, and more.
</p>

<h3 class="block-title">Counter Intel Actions</h3>

<p>
    All counter intel actions come at the cost of raising enemy agent awareness
    by a specific percentage. One this value reaches 100%, further actions will
    not be possible until it has sufficiently lowered. Enemy agent awareness
    lowers by a small amount every turn.
</p>

<p>You can protect yourself against incoming Intel in a number of methods. First
    you can use the
    <strong>uncover</strong>
    action to reveal any operations that are currently taking place against you.
    Additional uncovers will allow you to learn more details about the
    operation, such as spies deployed, accumulated intel points, and ultimately
    the player responsible.
</p>

<p>Once an operation is visible, you may use
    <strong>expel</strong>
    or
    <strong>deceive</strong>
    to take action against it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Expel</strong>
    - Expelling the enemy forces a percentage of the deployed spies to leave,
    slowing future progress and costing them food to redeploy. It
    may require multiple expulsion actions to remove the enemy completely.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Deceive</strong>
    - In order to prevent the enemy gaining a foothold within your realm, you
    will want to try and deceive them as much as possible. This action will
    lower the amount of intel the enemy may have on you.
