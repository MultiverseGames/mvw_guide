<h3 class="block-title">Ships - The Tools of war</h3>

<p>Our fleets were destroyed and our peoples were left with simple ships that while
could travel to other worlds, they could no longer protect our worlds the way
they once would. Technology such as weapons and cloaking were banned by the
peoples. Only the Warriors can command ships containing weapons. The ships that
exist today are a combination of multiple technologies. The ships the Warriors
will allow you can command their troops for battle are located here. We have 3
classes of weapons on each ship to choose from -
<strong>Laser, Photon and Plasma</strong>
. Each Tier has a variation of the different classes each designed to destroy the
other.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>Frigate</b>
| Unlocked - Superpower Level: 0
</dt>
<dd>These ships contain a crew of 10 warriors and has 1 forward canon, they are
light and nimble, and have no room for shields.
</dd>

<dt>
<b>Destroyer</b>
| Unlocked - Superpower Level: 2
</dt>
<dd>The Destroyer was created as a cheaper alternative to a fleet of thousands
of Frigates. Each ships has a crew of 20, and comes equipped with 2 canons,
and Type-1 shield generators, which help in fending off a Frigate attack
</dd>

<dt>
<b>Cruiser</b>
| Unlocked - Superpower Level: 4
</dt>
<dd>These ships are mid range ships with crews of 50 - 75. Their larger size
over Destroyers allow more weapons, shields and stronger hulls. These come
with 4 canons and Type-2 shield generators
</dd>

<dt>
<b>Battlecruiser</b>
| Unlocked - Superpower Level: 6
</dt>
<dd>At nearly double the size of a normal cruiser these ships are bulkier and
can take more of a beating than their smaller counterparts. These ships come
with 2 Type 2 shield generators, and 8 canons, manned normally by a crew of
100 - 150
</dd>

<dt>
<b>Battleship</b>
| Unlocked - Superpower Level: 7
</dt>
<dd>The Battleship was developed as a weapon to maintain peace, with 14 canons
and powerful Type-3 shields and an almost impregnable hull. Manned by 300
warriors, these ships are deadly to all who oppose them.
</dd>

<dt>
<b>Carrier</b>
| Unlocked - Superpower Level: 8
</dt>
<dd>The Carrier, also known as the Terror of the skies is a powerful ship
containing 24 Type-2 canons, two of the all powerful Type-3 shield
generators, and an enormous crew that keep on fighting. At 5 times the size
of cruisers these Terrors of the skies contain a crew of 1,200 warriors all
with a appetite for destruction of your enemies
</dd>

<dt>
<b>Dreadnought</b>
| Unlocked - Superpower Level: 9
</dt>
<dd>Dreadnoughts were developed specifically for the task of destroying
Carriers. These sleek powerhouses are aided by an army of Ground troops who
help the onboard crew target the Carriers from a safe location. Manned by a
crew of 200, and aided by 300 ground forces, these vessels come equipped
with 40 Type-2 canons, and Type-4 shield generators. The only way to defeat
one of these ships is to destroy all 1500 antennas, as just one is enough to
communicate with the ground crew who can still control the ship even if the
crew have all been killed!
</dd>

<dt>
<b>Super Carrier</b>
| Unlocked - Superpower Level: 10
</dt>
<dd>The largest starship ever created, over double the size of the already
enormous Carrier, with 65 Type-2 Canons, a Super Enhanced Type-4 shield
generator, the over 3,000 crew ensure that your name is known throughout the
universe by the survivors in their wake. All fear the darkening of the sun
as one of these massive Super Carriers appear as there is nowhere to hide
</dd>

<dt>
<b>Titan</b>
| Unlocked - Superpower Level: 12
</dt>
<dd>These are moon sized space craft, and are so superior in technological
advances that realistically only another Titan can match it's awesome power!
A crew of 10,000, 100 Type-3 Canons, and a Super Powerful Type-5 Shield
Generator. Few dare attack these powerful ships as fewer will live long
enough to regret attacking.
</dd>

<p>Not all ships are yours to command from the beginning, you must learn the skills
and develop the infrastructure necessary to be able to command a crew of each
Tier. These warrior ships are loyal to you, however all ships crews must be fed
by your world in order to keep them loyal to you. If you do not feed them, they
will not remain in your service and seek better conditions elsewhere!</p>

<h4 class="block-title">Ship Battles </h4>

<p>Each class of ship is more resistant at attacking another class, the table below
shows you what ships works best against the other class of ships. Higher tier
ships obviously are stronger against lower tiers. E.G. A Cruiser will almost
always defeat a Destroyer </p>

<div class="table-responsive overflow">
<table class="table tile table-condensed">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Attacker</td>
<td>Laser</td>
<td>Photon</td>
<td>Plasma</td>

<tr>
<td>Stronger than:</td>
<td>Photon</td>

<h4 class="block-title">Ship Battles - Attacks</h4>

<p>
As you see above, ships have 3 classes, Laser, Photon, Plasma. These then work
by the different tiers. You've already seen a Laser Cruiser defeats a Photon
Destroyer in a 1 on 1 battle. Lets look at some more variations on ship
battles. </p>

<p>
<strong>Player A - Attacker</strong>
has 10 Laser Frigate ships,
<strong>Player B - Defender</strong>
has 1 Photon Destroyer ship. Frigates come with 1 Attack Canon, and no shields,
while a Destroyer comes with 2 Attack Canons and a Type-1 shield emitter. As the
Laser class is more powerful (20%) than the Photon Class, the attack power
becomes 12. However, the Type-1 shield emitter reduces damage by 0.5, absorbed
onto the hull. Shields work on a per shot type basis and are not added together.
This means the total damage is now 7 (10 base, 2 attack bonus subtract shield
power 5). Ship destruction then depends on the Hull power. If your Hull Power is
decreased to 0 during the battle, your ship is destroyed. If you have multiple
ships, the ships move on to the next and the next until the attack run has
ended.

<h4 class="block-title">Ship Battles - Balancing</h4>
<p>
New players get some respite from battles, and their ships do not incur as much damage as more powerful players.
If the attacker / defender is in the same range of you, the damage is normal.
</p>

<h4 class="block-title">Ship Battles - Repairs</h4>

<p>The Repair Shop was introduced as a method for players to avoid completely
losing all of their ships. From here you can repair your damaged ships, and
return them to full working condition. Repairing costs a small percentage of the initial
credit and metal cost of the ship being repaired.</p>
