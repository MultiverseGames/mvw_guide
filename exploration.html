<h3 class="block-title">Ships - Exploration Mission</h3>

<p>Exploration Missions are a way to protect your ships while also earning a bit
extra. Each mission takes 7.5 hours to complete and provides you with some metal,
food, and credits that your ships discover in space. While your ships are out on
the exploration mission they will be unable to help in your defense or in any
attacks you wish to conduct on other players. This also means they can not be
destroyed when other players attack you! The size of the fleet you send will
determine the size of the reward returned!</p>
