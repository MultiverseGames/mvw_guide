<h3 class="block-title">MV Points - Use Points</h3>

<p>To further upgrade different aspects of your account you will need to come to
this page. To do these upgrades you will need MV Points. MV Points are earned by
logging in each day. You
<strong>must</strong>
log in once every 24 hours to earn Free MV Points. The other other way they can
be obtained is via donations to the site with real money via PayPal. These
donations will ensure the game is always there to be played and kept maintained
along with bugs removed and new features added periodically. MV Points can be
sent to other players from the Player page under "Give Resources". Free MV Points
are as good as the ones you purchase except for the fact that they can not be
given away to other players. You can donate as much money at one time to purchase
these points in sets of 10, 20, or 50 US Dollars. However you can only use them
at a set rate, each upgrade has a limit set to it to how many times per week it
can be used or if you see a n/a that means there's no limit. For information on
each upgrade just move your mouse over the question mark next to each.
